# **AQI Prediction Project**

## **Overview**

This project predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) category based on different air pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO₂, SO₂, O₃, and NH₃.
The goal of this project is to build a complete machine learning pipeline — from data collection to model training and real-time prediction.
Air pollution is a serious environmental issue, and predicting AQI can help people stay aware and take precautions when air quality becomes unhealthy.
